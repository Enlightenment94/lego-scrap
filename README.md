### 2. check-google.py
- Searches for LEGO products on Google
- Filters results by price
- Helps find the best deals for specific LEGO sets

### 3. lego-code-get.py
- Extracts LEGO product codes from links
- Processes data from files generated by lego-scrap.py
- Saves product codes for further analysis

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
